signal
A signal is a software generated interrupt that is sent to a process by the OS because of 
when user press ctrl-c or another process tell something to this process.
There are fix set of signals that can be sent to a process. signal are identified by integers.

The SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals are set aside for you to use any way you want. 
Theyâ€™re useful for simple interprocess communication, if you write a signal 
handler for them in the program that receives the signal. 

The sigemptyset() function initialises the signal set pointed to by set, such that all 
signals defined in this document are excluded. 

The sigaddset() function adds the individual signal specified by the signo to the 
signal set pointed to by set.

getpid() returns the process ID (PID) of the calling process.
(This is often used by routines that generate unique temporary
filenames.)
